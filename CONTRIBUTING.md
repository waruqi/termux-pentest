# Contributing guide

A simple way to help out is to check if new versions of packages have been
released, and then open a pull request to update it. The following instructions
can be run both from a GNU/Linux computer and from Termux.

Starting from scratch you need to:

 - [Learn general requirements](#general-requirements)
 - [Fork this repo](#forking-this-repo)
 - [Clone your fork](#clone-your-fork)
 - [Create a new branch](#creating-a-new-branch)
 - [Update a package](#updating-a-package)
 - [Commit changes and push to your fork](#commiting-changes-and-pushing-to-your-fork)
 - [Open a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request)

## General requirements

Requested and submitted packages must comply with following requirements:

 - Should be licensed under free open source license.
 - No Java dependency.
 - No X11 dependency.

All scripts should be formatted according to [our guideline](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Coding-guideline).

## Forking this repo

To be able to open a pull request you need to first fork this repo to your own
[Github](https://github.com) account. The changes you do will first be pushed
to your own fork and thereafter a pull request can be opened against the main
repo. Forking is done by pressing the "Fork" button in the upper right corner
of the repository page. See the Github help pages for more details:
[fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository).

## Clone your fork

Now that you have your own fork you can clone it to your Termux device or computer.
From a suitable location simply run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/unstable-packages
```

Note that it is also possible to [edit files directly in github](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository),
so this step could be skipped.

## Creating a new branch

It is recommended to create a new branch before making changes. This is done by
first checking out the master branch and making sure it is up to date, and then
checking out a new branch:
```sh
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b <package-name>-update
```

## Updating a package

Minor updates (going from for example v1.0.5 to v1.0.6) most often only means that
the fields `TERMUX_PKG_VERSION`, `TERMUX_PKG_REVISION` and `TERMUX_PKG_SHA256` needs
to be updated. The changes in the build.sh would then change something like:
```sh
[ ... ]
TERMUX_PKG_VERSION=1.0.5
TERMUX_PKG_REVISION=2
TERMUX_PKG_SRCURL=https://example.com/download/${TERMUX_PKG_VERSION}.tar.gz
TERMUX_PKG_SHA256=abde02986bc1fb112655bb5a3161dddfdc9436057fd8b305a01fe42b7dd247ae
[ ... ]
```
to
```sh
[ ... ]
TERMUX_PKG_VERSION=1.0.6
TERMUX_PKG_SRCURL=https://example.com/download/${TERMUX_PKG_VERSION}.tar.gz
TERMUX_PKG_SHA256=6116e607250198f224d9ce9304eba6bf0792d592c0b55209e496843192cc6860
[ ... ]
```

Note that the `TERMUX_PKG_REVISION` line has been deleted, when a package is updated
the REVISION should be reset to 0 and this line hence deleted. The value for `TERMUX_PKG_SHA256`
can be calculated by downloading the source archive and running `sha256sum` on it:

```sh
wget https://example.com/download/1.0.6.tar.gz
sha256sum 1.0.6.tar.gz
```

Major updates (going from for example v1.0.5 to v2.0.0) can mean that patches needs
to be updated or added. The CI build of the pull request will fail if patches need
to be updated, but only way to discover that new patches are needed is by testing
the built package in termux.

Revisions of dependent packages should be bumped in case of major updates to ensure
there will no be issues during runtime.

## Commiting changes and pushing to your fork

Now that the build.sh is updated we can commit it and push it to github so that a pull
request against the main repo can be opened. To commit with a short message you can run:
```sh
git add packages/<package-name>
git commit -m "<package-name>: update to 1.0.6"
```

If you want to upload your changes to the remote repository, do:
```sh
git push origin
```
`origin` here is the repository that you originally cloned, which in this example is
your fork. The full url to this repository can be shown by running `git remote -v`.

## Opening a pull request

You can now visit your repo in a browser and open a pull request against this repo by
pressing "New pull request". See [creating-a-pull-request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
for more information on how to do this.

Once a pull request has been created CI system will attempt to build the changes.
